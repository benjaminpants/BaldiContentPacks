### Baldi's Basics Plus Content Packs
This repo contains the up to date source code for all of my "pack" mods.

A pack mod is just a collection of content with a specific theme, I do this so if people don't like the content included in a pack they can just not install it.

And, maintaining multiple, smaller mods, is easier than maintaining one big mod, and I personally believe that BB+ mods should be focused in their scope.
